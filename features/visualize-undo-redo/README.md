# Visualize - Undo/Reo
> Improved the user experience on undoing and redoing by 
showing the `undo-tree-visualizer` at the second window.

By having the `undo-tree-visualizer` you can easily see 
the undo/redo history. The tree will only be shown when 
you are undoing or redoing. Once you type something, save 
the file or kill the buffer the tree will be gone.
