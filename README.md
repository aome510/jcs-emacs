This is Jen-Chieh Shen's emacs configuration, continually used and 
tweaked since 2015, and it might be a good starting point for other 
Emacs users, especially for those who like to program all kind of

The config should run on Emacs 24.3 or higher, but still, recommend 
to always run on the latest Emacs version available to you.
